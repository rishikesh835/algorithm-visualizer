# Graph Algorithms Visualizer

## Overview

Graph Algorithms Visualizer is a Java-based interactive tool designed to help users understand and analyze various graph algorithms. By offering real-time visualization, the tool demonstrates the step-by-step execution of algorithms, making it easier for users to comprehend complex concepts and enhance their problem-solving skills.

## Features

- **Interactive Graph Creation:** Users can create custom graphs by adding nodes and edges.
- **Algorithm Visualization:** Supports visualization of popular graph algorithms such as:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
  - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
  - Kruskal's Algorithm
  - Prim's Algorithm
- **Step-by-Step Execution:** Animates the progress of algorithms, showing visited nodes, updated paths, and shortest distances.
- **Customizable Inputs:** Users can define edge weights, graph types (directed/undirected), and more.
- **Performance Metrics:** Displays computational steps and time complexity during the execution.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **GUI Framework:** JavaFX or Swing
- **Data Structures:** Custom implementation for graph representation (Adjacency List/Matrix)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rishikesh835/algorithm-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).
3. Build the project to download required dependencies.
4. Run the main class to start the application.

## How to Use

1. Launch the application.(Run the ApplicationRunner.java file in src/visualizer folder in IntellijiIdea)
2. Create a graph by adding nodes and connecting them with edges.
3. Select an algorithm from the menu.
4. Click the "Start Visualization" button to see the algorithm in action.
5. Adjust parameters as needed to experiment with different scenarios.
